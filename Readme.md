# Motivation for project

I've made several half complete games in the passed,
while all either technically impressive
or architectually interesting.
None of them were fun.

So rather then making something impressive,
I want to make something fun this time.
I'm quite sure I can do this.
I just need to know what fun is.

The current name is a code name.
It's also a joke on that I've already gained a fair bit of experience in this,
but never actually released anything to *anyone* else.

# Insipiration

Remember that moment in [aoe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/Age_of_Empires_II_2013/),
when you breach the enemy defenses,
your cavalry strides into the enemy encampment and so many villagers die?
That feeling is amazing.
Or in [ck2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/203770/Crusader_Kings_II/),
when your Vikings sail
next to some English coast, burn a monestary or two to the ground
and hop back into the longboat before the enemy king shows up with 10'000 knights? 
That's what I want to recreate.
Just the feeling of pillaging and grabbing things that aren't yours,
yet with a healthy pressure to get out after you got the goods.



# Research into game design
## Basics vid

Scope: Keep it small and simple
+ First goal is to make something I can play ASAP

Don't lock into a single idea.
Only build things I'm pretty sure I can do (no 3d lol).

If stuck ask people.

Design around resources. In this case my skills.
So we probably want to use fewer assets or i should just practice making artwork.
Shouldn't be to hard.

## Make rules

It tells me to not worry to much about design.
So let's write down something simple for now and stop this.


# Assets
I don't know how to draw.
So I'm using these resources:

Thanks for creating these!
