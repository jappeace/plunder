What to finish to make an minimal game:

1.5 Make a win condition
 Maybe destroying all houses?

2. fixup ux (currently we don't even know we're dead)
   + on player death the game resets but there is no feedback

3. make small website to publish it. (yesod)

At this point it's a real game (even though bad).
So we can try making it more fun.
